gxtCrudExample
==============
This is a working example of a CRUD (create, read, update and delete) editor for Google App Engine amd GXT 3.1.
The editor supports Objectify Reference fields to other App Engine classes.
If such a field is edited a sub editor appears which allows the user to select entities of the other class.

Furthermore the App Engine server part is designed to support paging, filtering and sorting of datasets.

A running instance of this Example can be tested at http://lunar-parsec-618.appspot.com/WebAdmin.html
